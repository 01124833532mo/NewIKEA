# Multi-Layered MVC Application
## Overview
This project is a modular MVC-based application designed using Multi-Layer Architecture (PL, BLL, DAL) to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. It includes a dynamic Presentation Layer (PL) with features for CRUD operations and a robust backend to manage business logic and data access efficiently.

The application implements key design patterns like Generic Repository and Unit of Work to ensure flexibility and reusability. It also integrates Entity Framework Core and SQL Server for database management and ASP.NET Identity for secure user authentication and authorization.
